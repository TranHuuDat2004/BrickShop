## Installation & Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (Version >= 16.x recommended)
*   npm / yarn
*   MySQL Server (Installed and running)
*   Git

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TranHuuDat2004/Keeppley_Nodejs
    cd your_project_directory_name # e.g., cd Keeppley_Nodejs
    ```
2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd backend # Or your backend directory name
    npm install
    # or: yarn install
    ```
3.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Log in to your MySQL server.
    *   Create a new database (e.g., `keeppley-shop` or `brickshop_db`).
    *   Import the database schema or run migrations to create the necessary tables (e.g., `users`, `products`, `categories`, `orders`, `vouchers`...).

### Environment Variables

1.  In the `backend` directory, create a `.env` file.
2.  Add the required environment variables. Example:
    ```dotenv
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=your_mysql_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
    DB_NAME=brickshop_db # Use the name you created
    DB_PORT=3306
    PORT=3001 # Port for the backend server
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_for_jwt # Important for security
    # Add other keys if needed (e.g., QR Payment Gateway keys)
    ```
3.  Replace placeholder values (`your_mysql_user`, `your_mysql_password`, etc.) with your actual configuration.

### Running the Project

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start
    # Or if you have a development script: npm run dev
    ```
    The server will run on the port specified in your `.env` file (e.g., `http://localhost:3001`).

2.  **Open the Frontend:**
    *   Open the user interface HTML files (e.g., `index.html`, `products.html`) directly in your web browser.
    *   Open the admin interface HTML files (e.g., `admin/index.html`) directly in your web browser.
    *   **Important:** Ensure the JavaScript files in the frontend are configured to make API calls to the correct backend address (e.g., `fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/products')`).
